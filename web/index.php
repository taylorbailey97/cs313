            <h3>A little about me</h3>
            <p>
                I study at Brigham Young University - Idaho, I am a software engineer
                with a focus on full stack development. In my educational career I
                have learned to write professional code, present myself in both a
                technical and professional setting, and work together with classmates
                to complete projects within deadlines. I have been fascinated with
                computers their inner-workings since I was young. Often I found myself
                switching components in the computer to make it faster, sometimes
                discovering that some of the components didn't make a difference. I
                later became interested in the software side of my computer;
                eventually, looking up how to learn to code on my own. It wasn't until
                college that I found a true passion for software development, more
                specifically web development.
